I am a junior at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) pursing a degree in Computer Science, with a concentration in system software and information systems. My interests mainly revolve around computer systems and networks. 

I'll make sure this page doesn't look blank once I actually have an interesting life.
